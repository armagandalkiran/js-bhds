// DEFINITION

// JavaScript is a high-level
// object-oriented, multi-paradigm
// programming language.

// KEYWORDS 

// high-level
// prototype-based object-oriented
// multi-paradigm
// interpreted or just-in-time compiled
// dynamic
// single-threaded
// garbage-collected
// first-class functions
// event loop concurrency model

HİGH-LEVEL: 

Any computer program needs resources

Low level languages like C Developers
has to manage resources manually

High level languages like python Developers
does not have to worry, everything happens
automatically.

GARBAGE-COLLECTED:

Powerful tool of taking memory management
away from developers.

- an algorithm inside JavaScript engine.
- removes old, unused objects from memory.

INTERPRETED or JUST-IN-TIME COMPILED

The intermediate code is converted into 
machine language only when the application
needs that is required 
codes are only converted to machine code.


MULTI-PARADIGM

paradigm: An approach and mindset of structuring
code, which will direct your coding style and technique.

1) Procedural programming
2) Object oriented programming
3) Functional programming

PROTOTYPE-BASED OBJECT-ORIENTED

FİRST-CLASS FUNCTIONS

In a language with first-class functions, functions
are simply treated as variables. We can pass
them into other functions, and return them
from functions.


DYNAMIC

No data type definitions. Types becomes
known at runtime.

Data type of variable is automatically changed.


SINGLE-THREADED

concurrency model: How the JavaScript engine
handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.

why do we need that ?

JavaScript runs in one single thread, so
it can only do one thing at a time.

so what about a long-running task ?

Sounds like it would block the single thread.
However, we want non-blocking behavior.

how do we achieve that then ?

By using an EVENT LOOP: takes long running
tasks, executes them in the "background", and
puts them back in the main thread once they are finished.
